## Quick Start

1. **Understanding the Project**: Start with [`specs/feature-specification.md`](specs/feature-specification.md) to understand what the project does and its features.

2. **Setting Up Development**: Follow [`specs/development-setup.md`](specs/development-setup.md) to get your development environment ready.

3. **Understanding the Architecture**: Read [`specs/architecture.md`](specs/architecture.md) to understand the current system design and technical implementation.

4. **Implementation Planning**: Review [`specs/implementation-plan.md`](specs/implementation-plan.md) for the current implementation plan and priorities.

5. **Reviewing Improvements**: Check [`specs/architecture-improvements.md`](specs/architecture-improvements.md) for a comprehensive overview of proposed enhancements.

6. **Working on Tickets**: See the [`tickets/`](tickets/) directory for specific improvement tasks with detailed implementation steps. Use [`process/TICKET_CREATION_GUIDE.md`](process/TICKET_CREATION_GUIDE.md) when creating new tickets.

7. **Development Processes**: Review [`process/COMMITS.md`](process/COMMITS.md) and [`process/TICKETS.md`](process/TICKETS.md) for development conventions.
